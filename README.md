Reto País Drupal Distribution

## Dependencies

* VirtualBox: 5.x
* Vagrant: 1.7.x
* Ansible (optional, but recommended): 1.9.x

### Mac

```bash
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
brew install ansible
```

### Vagrant

Two plugins are required.

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network
```

### Wraith
In this generator we include Wraith for visual regression testing, to use it go to `wraith/configs/capture.yaml` and change the domains urls, the paths you want to test and the breakpoints if needed, then go back to the root path of your project and run:

```
./scripts/retopais_wraith_testing.sh
```
Once finished the execution of the script go to:

```
wraith/shots
```
And that's it, now you can make sure everything looks as expected just by opening the generated gallery in your browser.
